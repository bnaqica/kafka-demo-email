# CLAUDE.md — kafka-demo-email

Listens to `customer-change-event`, saves each incoming event in MongoDB, skips any it has already processed, and sends the matching email: a welcome, a change notice, or a removal notice.

One of four repos in the Kafka Demo system (customer, email, analytics, ui). Local infrastructure lives
in `../../local-docker`. Full picture: `docs/architecture.md`. Event contracts: `docs/kafka-events.md`.

## Never commit

Claude does not commit, push, merge, rebase or open PRs in this repo — the developer reviews and commits
every change. A hook enforces this. See `.claude/rules/git-workflow.md`.

## Commands

```bash
./gradlew build              # compile, test, coverage report, formatting check (Docker must be running)
./gradlew test               # tests only (Docker must be running)
./gradlew spotlessApply      # format the code
./gradlew bootRun            # run against local-docker (profile `local`)
./gradlew jibDockerBuild     # container image into the local Docker daemon
```

## Stack

Java 25 (Gradle toolchain), Spring Boot 4.1 (Jackson 3 — `tools.jackson.*`, not `com.fasterxml.jackson.*`),
Spring Kafka, MongoDB, Flyway, JUnit, Testcontainers, Spring Security (JWT), springdoc, Spotless, JaCoCo, Lombok, SLF4J, Jib. Port 8082.

  dto/response/ objects returned by the API
  dto/request/  request bodies received by the API

  application.yml          defaults; values from environment variables
  application-local.yml    local-docker settings (profile `local`)

src/test/java/...          tests mirror the main package layout
```

## Conventions

- Constructor injection only, generated with Lombok `@RequiredArgsConstructor`; no field `@Autowired`.
- Log with Lombok `@Slf4j` (SLF4J, `{}` placeholders); never `System.out`.
- Request/response DTOs and Kafka events are Java `record`s.
- Inject `java.time.Clock` instead of calling `Instant.now()` directly, so tests can fix time.
- Kafka values are JSON strings serialized with the injected `JsonMapper`; no type headers.
- Config lives in `application.yml` with `${ENV_VAR}` placeholders; local values only in `application-local.yml`.
- Migrations: JSON files in `src/main/resources/db/migration` (`V<n>__<description>.json`), run on startup by Flyway's native MongoDB connector (`config/MongoFlywayConfig`). **Each file holds exactly one MongoDB command** (what you would pass to `db.runCommand`); Flyway only runs the first command in a file. History is kept in the `flyway_schema_history` collection. Never edit a migration that has been applied — add a new version.
- Tests mirror the main package. Unit-test services with Mockito; use `@WebMvcTest` for controllers.
- Database tests run against real MongoDB through Testcontainers: `@Import(TestcontainersConfiguration.class)`.
  Don't use an embedded database.
- Every endpoint needs a JWT in every profile, except the health check. The `local` profile only opens the Swagger pages.

## Workflow

Features start with `/opsx:propose`, not `superpowers:brainstorming`. `/opsx:apply` builds them with
`superpowers:test-driven-development`, and code review uses `superpowers:requesting-code-review`.
Finish with `/opsx:archive` after the developer has reviewed. See `.claude/rules/development-workflow.md`.

## More rules

`.claude/rules/` holds the detailed rules (git workflow, development workflow, design principles, package structure, service architecture, Java/Spring, Kafka contracts).
`.claude/agents/` holds review subagents. OpenSpec commands are under `/opsx:*`.
Superpowers is enabled in `.claude/settings.json`; skip any of its steps that commit.
